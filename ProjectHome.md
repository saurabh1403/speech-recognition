the speech recognition methods are quite useful in today's life and find a lot of applications in modern technology. speech recognition involves the matching of two speech signals within the permissible range.

Integration of speech recognition method in open moko will give rise to a lot of applications and services like security system using voice password etc. there are many methods which are used to do speech recognition. Hidden Markov Model is one of them which is very popular for speech recognition. A success rate of upto 90% can be achieved using HMM.
